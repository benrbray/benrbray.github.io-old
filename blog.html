		<p>The Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance algorithm is a method of determining the minimum distance between two convex sets. Unlike many other distance algorithms, it does not require that the geometry data be stored in any specific format, but instead relies solely on a support function to iteratively generate closer simplices to the correct answer using the configuration space obstacle (CSO) of two convex shapes, more commonly known as the Minkowski difference.</p>

		<span class="post-date">Wed, 21 Aug 2019.</span>
		<p>There are two versions of Newton's method, one for root-finding, <span class="math">\(f(x) = 0\)</span>, and one for optimization, <span class="math">\(min_{x \in \R^n} f(x)\)</span>.  In this post, I show explicitly that Newton's method for optimization is simply Newton's method applied to finding fixed points of the gradient map <span class="math">\(x \mapsto \nabla x f\)</span>.</p>

		<span class="post-date">Tue, 20 Aug 2019.</span>
		<p>Mathematicians tend to agree that gradients are row vectors, but for some reason computer scientists can't get on borad with the idea.  The goal of this post is to explain why gradients are most naturally expressed as row vectors, and to demonstrate the advantages of this perspective.</p>

		<span class="post-date">Wed, 02 May 2018.</span>
		<p>Many applications require the random sampling of matrices with prescribed structure for modeling, statistical, or aesthetic purposes.  What does it mean for a random variable to be matrix-valued?  What can we say about the eigenvalues of a random matrix?  How can we design algorithms to sample from a target distribution on a group or manifold?  More generally, what can we say deterministic algorithms with random inputs?  Our study of random matrices will lead us to the <em>subgroup algorithm</em> (Diaconis 1987), which subsumes many familiar random sampling procedures.</p>

		<span class="post-date">Sat, 17 Jun 2017.</span>
		<p>In geometry, the hyperplane separation theorem is a theorem about disjoint convex sets in n-dimensional Euclidean space. There are several rather similar versions. In one version of the theorem, if both these sets are closed and at least one of them is compact, then there is a hyperplane in between them and even two parallel hyperplanes in between them separated by a gap. In another version, if both disjoint convex sets are open, then there is a hyperplane in between them, but not necessarily any gap. An axis which is orthogonal to a separating hyperplane is a separating axis, because the orthogonal projections of the convex bodies onto the axis are disjoint.</p>

		<p>What is the most effective way to generate random samples, assuming we have access to a pseudorandom number generator?  In this post, we'll explore several common algorithms.</p>

		<a class="post-title" href="posts/2015/expectation-maximization">Expectation Maximization</a>
		<span class="post-date">Thu, 26 Nov 2015.</span>
		<p>These notes provide a theoretical treatment of <strong>Expectation-Maximization</strong>, an iterative parameter estimation algorithm used to find local maxima of the likelihood function in the presence of hidden variables.  Introductory textbooks (MLAPP, PRML) typically state the algorithm without explanation and expect students to work blindly through derivations.  We find this approach to be unsatisfying, and instead choose to tackle the theory head-on, followed by plenty of examples.  Following (Neal &amp; Hinton 1998), we view expectation-maximization as coordinate ascent on the <strong>Evidence Lower Bound</strong>.  This perspective takes much of the mystery out of the algorithm and allows us to easily derive variants like <strong>Hard EM</strong> and <strong>Variational Inference</strong>.</p>
